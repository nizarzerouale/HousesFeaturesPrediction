# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Laboratory : Application for houses features insights

## Overview
This laboratory project aims to explore the fundamentals of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) through practical applications. The project is divided into two main parts:
1. Implementing logical gates (AND/XOR) using ANN.
2. Developing and evaluating an ANN model for a regression problem using Keras.

## Objectives
- Gain intuition on basic ANN concepts such as input signals, synaptic weights, bias, activation functions, and back-propagation.
- Implement ANN models from scratch in Python for logical operations.
- Utilize Keras to develop and evaluate ANN models for regression problems.

## Theoretical Aspects
The project covers key topics in machine learning and deep learning, including the structure and functioning of biological and artificial neurons, perceptrons, and the implementation of various regression models.

### Artificial Neural Network
- ANN as an information processing paradigm.
- The basic model of ANN architecture inspired by biological neurons.

### ANN for Regression
- Introduction to regression models and their applications.
- Various types of regression mechanisms (linear, polynomial, logistic).

## Practical Implementation
The project consists of several applications, each designed to reinforce the understanding and application of ANNs in solving practical problems.

### Application 1: Logical Gates Implementation
- Implementing AND and XOR gates using ANN.
- Focus on single-layer and multilayer perceptrons.

### Application 2: ANN for Regression with Keras
- Developing a regression model with Keras.
- Loading and processing CSV datasets.
- Creating, training, and evaluating the neural network model.

## Requirements
- Python programming language.
- Understanding of basic machine learning and neural network concepts.
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Keras (with TensorFlow backend).
